      <div class="tab-content">
        <p>Home care is when a professional caregiver comes to you to help with the activities of daily living (ADLs), the things we all do to stay happy and healthy. That could mean a steady arm to hold on your daily walk—and some friendly encouragement to get up and out the door. Home care also can mean help with medication reminders, grocery shopping and meal preparation, bathing and personal care, light housekeeping and other household chores, or just good conversation over coffee. </br></br>
Home care is help with just about anything you need to continue to live in your home safely and happily as you age.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. While our office and RN management teams have great relationships with our experienced caregivers, we understand that it can be difficult for clients to invite a new person into their home for the first time. We run these background checks monthly to provide an extra sense of security ensuring all of our caregivers are in good standing.</p>

		 <label for="tab-four">What are my home care options?</label>
      <div class="tab-content">
		  <p>For most families, home care is the preferred option when it’s no longer safe for a loved one to be completely on their own. According to recent surveys, over 90 percent of people 65 and older want to stay in their home, living in a familiar place with as much independence as possible.</br></br>
          Setting up in-home care is not the only option. And it may not be the best choice for your family right now.</br></br>
          Adult day care can be a good option when a loved one is still able to live at home but needs companionship and supervision or wants to socialize, make new friends, and do activities with others. Adult day care may not be the right choice if your loved one needs support with mobility, memory care, or help with toileting.
          </br></br>
          If health issues become more serious, a spouse dies, or family members don’t live nearby, an assisted living facility is a good option to explore. While you’ll have the added expenses of moving to the facility, your loved one will get many benefits—living with some privacy in a small community, organized social activities, a communal dining area, and housekeeping services or other support as needed.</br></br>
          Nursing homes are usually the last choice for most families since there is little, if any, privacy for your loved one, and the physical health and mental condition of the other residents has a huge effect on your loved one’s quality of life. But there are times when a nursing home is the best option for a loved one who has severe Alzheimer’s, other dementia, or is in the late stages of another illness.

		 <label for="tab-six">How do I pay for home?</label>
      <div class="tab-content">
        <p class="before-list">For most families, these are the best options for paying for in-home care:
        </br></br>
        <span class="semibold">1. Look into insurance</span></br></br>
        Long-term care insurance – Some people assume that long-term care insurance is primarily for assisted living, but it usually pays for in-home care professionals, too. As a result, you can be reimbursed for your payments to home care agencies that meet the requirements of your policy. If you’re planning for your own future, especially if you want to continue to live at home while receiving care, the earlier you start applying for long-term care, the better.
        </br></br>
        Life insurance – If you have a life insurance policy, you may be able to convert it into a long-term care benefit plan, providing cash monthly payouts for in-home care. Check with your insurance provider for details on your plan.</br></br>
        <span class="semibold">2. Use your personal assets</span>
        </br></br>
        Most families wind up using personal savings to meet the needs of caring for an older loved one. Paying out-of-pocket can pose a hardship for many family members if the person needing care doesn’t have enough savings or assets to cover their own needs. Here are some creative ways families manage the challenge:</br></br>
        Divvy up the duties – Call a family meeting on behalf of your loved one to determine what needs to be done and who has the time, ability, or resources to do it. Family members who live farther away may be able to offer more financial help. Those living nearby may be able to assist with driving, shopping, or personal care. When outside help is needed, determine together how you will share the cost. It’s best to come to an agreement early and then adjust as the circumstances change.</br></br>
        Tap into home equity – If your loved one owns her own home, consider a home equity loan to defray the costs of professional in-home care.</br></br>
        Move in with Mom – Is there someone in the family who would be a good roommate and also could benefit from free room and board in exchange for help with dressing, cooking, cleaning, and walking the dog? A college student or single adult might be able to shrink out-of-pocket costs for caregiving by being there during non-work or school hours.</br></br>
        <span class="semibold">3. Access public programs</span></br></br>
        These programs serve people with very low incomes:
        </p>
        <div class="list-with-arrows">
			<p>Medicaid covers some short-term care if you’ve had a hospital or skilled nursing stay or rehabilitation.</p>
			<p>PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly) provides comprehensive medical and social services to certain frail, community-dwelling elderly individuals, most of whom are also eligible for Medicare and Medicaid benefits.</p>
			<p>Veterans Affairs (VA) provides veterans and eligible surviving spouses with some in-home care assistance through VA health benefits. Learn more about home care benefits for Veterans and see if you are eligible.</p>
			<p>Cash and Counseling programs pay you or other family members for providing care for a relative. In some states, these programs are run by Medicaid or other state agency. They pay older people directly to cover some of their in-home care costs. Programs vary by state and go by different names. In Pennsylvania, for example, this program called xxxxxxxxxxx</p>
