					<h3>Scott Parlee</h3><span>Founder & Executive Director</span>
					<p>Scott has worked with older adults in the Home Care space for the last 20 years. He has run several local home care agencies, created chronic care management programs for large hospital systems like Massachusetts General Hospital, and designed wellness solutions for older adults including Weight Watchers®. His experiences repeatedly reinforced that the existing home care services / agencies often lack the quality, visibility and value that families desperately seek.</br></br>
					
					Scott founded Believe determined to create a better home care model. One which empowers caregivers to deliver exceptional care, constantly measures satisfaction, ensures 100% service transparency, cuts operational inefficiencies and empowers caregivers to deliver exceptional care. Families deserve simple and value-driven home care, and Scott is determined to provide it. He received his BS in Engineering from Brown University, and an MBA from Kellogg, Northwestern’s Business School. He is from and currently lives in Bucks County, PA</p>

					<h3>Terry Parlee</h3><span>Certified Nursing Assistant</span>
					
					<p>Terry grew up in Philadelphia, one of seven children, and graduated cum laude from Temple University with a degree in journalism. She spent 15 years as communications director in various healthcare settings and took graduate courses in health care administration at St. Joseph University. She is happily married to Scott and the blessed mother of their three children. She looks back with gratitude on the time when she was able to help care for her father after he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.</br></br>
					That experience, along with being in the company of her 90-year-old mother led Terry to become a certified nurse assistant and pursue a rewarding career as a caregiver. She is inspired by Believe’s mission that homecare can be better and is committed to making that a reality for families and their loved ones
